Hello, this was my third assignment for my Introduction to Machine Learning Course! Here, we created a CNN(Convolutional Neural Network) for changing the pixels of an image to be enlarged. I did one version with an RGB Autoencoder and I did one with a Grayscale Autoencoder to see which model performs better.
